# Agent instructions

- Work only within this 02-coding-interview project directory.
- Read product-spec.md before changing product behavior.
- Keep frontend transport calls behind frontend/src/services/.
- Do not execute user-provided code on the backend.
- Run the relevant tests before committing a completed workflow phase.
- Make a concise local Git commit after each verified phase. Do not push unless
  explicitly asked.
- For deployment work, keep the app and Postgres runnable through Docker
  Compose; add an integration check and a two-browser end-to-end check before
  enabling deployment automation.
- Railway production deployments must use the managed PostgreSQL service via
  `DATABASE_URL`. Keep Railway tokens in GitHub secrets and public deployment
  identifiers in GitHub variables; never commit credential values.
